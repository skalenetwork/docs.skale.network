= Indexing Skale on-chain data via Flair

With https://flair.dev[Flair], you can index custom data on your Skale chain in real-time and also for historical data.

## Why Flair?

Compared to other alternatives the main reasons are:

* üöÄ  Adopting **parallel and distributed processing** paradigm means high scalability and resiliency for your indexing stack. Instead of constrained sequential processing (e.g Subgraph).
* üß©  Focused on **primitives**, which means on the left you plug-in an RPC and on the right you output the data to any destination database.
* üöÑ  Native **real-time stream processing** for certain data workload (such as aggregations, rollups) for things like total volume per pool, or total portfolio per user wallet.
* ‚òÅÔ∏è  **Managed** cloud services avoid DevOps and irrelevant engineering costs for dApp developers.
* üßë‚Äçüíª  Avoid decentralization **overhead** (consensus, network hops, etc) since we believe to enable best UX for dApps reading data must be as close to the developers as possible.

## Features

* ‚úÖ Listen to **any EVM chain** with just an RPC URL.
  ** Free managed RPC URLs for +8 popular chains already included.
  ** Works with both websocket and https-only RPCs.
* ‚úÖ Track and ingest **any contract** for **any event topic.**
  ** Auto-track new contracts deployed from factory contracts.
* ‚úÖ **Custom processor scripts** with JavaScript runtime (with **Typescript** support)
  ** Make external API or Webhook calls to third-party or your backend.
  ** Get current or historical USD value of any ERC20 token amount of any contract address on any chain.
  ** Use any external NPM library.
* ‚úÖ **Stream** any stored data to your destination database (Postgres, MongoDB, MySQL, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Timescale, etc).

## Getting Started

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the https://github.com/flair-sdk/starter-boilerplate[starter boilerplate] template and follow the instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flair-sdk/starter-boilerplate.git
# ... follow instructions in README.md
```
[NOTE]

Boilerplate instructions will create a **new cluster**, generate **an API Key**, and set up a manifest.yml to index your **first contract** with **sample custom processor** scripts.
Learn more about the https://docs.flair.dev/reference/manifest.yml[structure of manifest.yml].


2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Skale RPC nodes

Set a unique namespace, Skale chainId and RPC endpoint in your config. 

**Note:** Remember that you can add up to 10 RPC endpoints for resiliency.

**Note:** It is recommended to use an archive node as the rpc endpoint over a traditional proxied endpoint, however, a proxy endpoint can be used if no historical data is required and a block rotation has not occured.

```yaml
{
  "cluster": "dev",
  "namespace": "my-awesome-skale-indexing-dev",
  "indexers": [
    {
      "chainId": 1351057110,
      "enabled": true,
      "ingestionFilterGroup": "default",
      "processingFilterGroup": "default",
      "sources": [
        # Highly-recommended to have at least 1 websocket endpoint
        "wss://staging-v3.skalenodes.com/v1/ws/staging-fast-active-bellatrix",
        # You can put multiple endpoints for failover
        "https://staging-v3.skalenodes.com/v1/staging-fast-active-bellatrix"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

3Ô∏è‚É£  Sync some historical data using https://docs.flair.dev/reference/backfilling[backfill command]. Remember that `enabled: true` flag in your `config` enabled your indexer to capture data in real-time already.

```bash
# backfill certain contracts or block ranges
pnpm flair backfill --chain 1351057110 --address 
0xb842faf994f7a2be83e4587a9fcfe8c7bd08670c -d backward --max-blocks 10000

# backfill for a specific block number, if you have certain events you wanna test with
pnpm flair backfill --chain 1351057110 -b 2041846

# backfill for the recent data in the last X minute
pnpm flair backfill --chain 1351057110 --min-timestamp="30 mins ago" -d backward
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ Stream the data to your https://docs.flair.dev/reference/database#your-own-database[own database].
