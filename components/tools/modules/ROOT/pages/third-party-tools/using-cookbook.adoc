== How To Use Cookbook

The following sections will help guide you through using the no-code deployment tools seen in the example video above. You will learn how to search, deploy, and view your deployed smart contracts.

=== Search on the smart contract registry

Start by navigating to link:https://cookbook.dev[Cookbook] and search for the smart contract you would like to use or deploy.

[TIP]
You can try searching for topics such as token or dao.

=== Using No Code Deployment 

Once you have chosen your smart contract, proceed by clicking on *No-Code Deploy*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* It is recommended to use the No-Code Deployment option as it will handle SKALE Chain access and sFUEL ("gas token") distribution for you.
+
* Other options such as Remix, ChainIDE, and manual deployment may require additional steps that are not listed here.

* Want to explore these options? Join the link:https://discord.com/invite/gM5XBy6[SKALE Discord] and ask for assistance.

You can now configure your smart contract with the parameters you want. In the example below, you would put in the name of your token (eg. TOKEN) , the token symbol (eg. SYM), the total supply (eg. 100000), and lastly the selection of 0 or 18 for NFT or ERC-20. Once all the fields are filled in, select *Pick Chain*

Navigate to the SKALE tab and select your preferred chain. Be sure to click *_Get sFUEL_* if you don't have any.

=== Check your deployed smart contract on Dashboard

Once the smart contract is deployed, you may check the address on the "My Dashboard" page.
On this page you can:

* Download the ABI, Bytecode, Source Code, or Verification Data

* Read directly from the contract

* Write directly to the contract (if you have permission to do so)
