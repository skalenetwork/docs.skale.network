== IMA Bridge

.How do I use the bridge? 

Bridge ABIs for ETHAmsterdam chains are located here: https://github.com/skalenetwork/skale-network/tree/master/releases/eth-amsterdam

.How is the EthAmsterdam bridge configured?

IMA Bridge for EthAmsterdam has the *whitelist enabled* and *automatic deployment* is turned on. This means that you will not need to manually map tokens. As soon as tokens are deposited, a basic clone will be created on your chain.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There are several limits to using automatic deployment. When using this method:

* All token types support only basic token functionality. For example, special features such as ERC777 hooks and operators, fee-on-transfer, inflationary, etc., **will not** be mapped over. Be sure to review the token features supported by automatic deployment of each token type here: <https://github.com/skalenetwork/IMA/tree/develop/proxy/contracts/schain/tokens>. If you require any specialized features, please use the manual mapping process.
* ERC20 token clones are based on OpenZeppelin's library and use 18 decimals. See: <https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/d4d8d2ed9798cc3383912a23b5e8d5cb602f7d4b/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L87>. If you require a different representation, then use the manual deployment process.
