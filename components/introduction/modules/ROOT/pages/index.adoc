= About SKALE Network

== What is SKALE Network 

The SKALE Network is an open-source, Ethereum-native multichain network built to scale Ethereum dApps with a focus on high-throughput, fast finality, and zero gas fee transactions via the native gas token sFuel.

== What problems does SKALE solve?

^.^s|_Poor web3 user experience_

** end-users required to pay gas fees
** low speed and latency
** connectivity and messaging between chains

^.^s| _Scalability Trilemma_

** speed
** security
** decentralization

^.^s| _Strict and ineffective blockchains_

** Lack of customization and control
** Lack of horizontal scaling
** Block gas limits and gas costs limiting what and how data/transactions are put on-chain

== What does SKALE offer?

* `Zero gas fees` - by design, developers and end-users never pay for transactions.
* `Instant finality` - the fastest chain to finality. Time to finality = blocktime.
* `High performance`
** `Throughput` - Baseline of 400 transactions per second (tps) and up to 700 tps at peak.
** `High block gas limit` - 280 million block gas limit allowing optimal throughput and complex transactions/smart contracts to be executed, like xref:tools::skale-specific/ml.adoc[on-chain Machine Learning].
* `Purpose-built chains`- app-chains and hub-chains for customization and and horizontal scaling.
* `Native bridge` - Fast flexible, offering 18 second finality between chains. Direct support for popular token standards such as ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 with additional flexibility for passing any arbitrary data through the low-level messaging protocol.
* `Native oracle` - decentralized and transaction free oracle enabling developers to read off-chain data.
* `Decentralization and fault tolerance` - chains supported by 16 randomly chosen and rotated SKALE Validator nodes, with a BFT tolerance of 1/3.
* `Layered Blockchain Security` - unique hybrid Layer 1/Layer 2 architecture that partially derives security from Ethereum and with the performance and decentralization of a Layer 1.

== How does SKALE do this?

The Network enables dApp developers to access validator-operated nodes' compute power and storage to run fast, containerized, EVM-compatible chains called SKALE Chains.

SKALE chains can exchange transactions or messages with other SKALE Chains and the Ethereum Mainnet through the native validator secured bridge (IMA), allowing dApp developers to use SKALE for powering their dApps while enabling token and message transfers to and from Ethereum or other chains.

With SKALE, dApps run zero-cost transactions on dedicated Proof-of-Stake chains distributed across a randomly chosen set of 16 nodes.

Decentralized validator organizations run and maintain SKALE Nodes, providing distributed computing power and storage to the SKALE Network.

Built on the foundation it services, SKALE Network is managed and operated by over 35 smart contracts deployed on Ethereum mainnet that make up SKALE Manager. 

These smart contracts control network functions such as chain creation, validator registration, node selection, node rotation, staking, bounty payment, slashing, and more.

Network users such as validators, delegators, and dApp Developers exchange SKL tokens to provide stake and access network services.

The https://skale.space/blog/validator-list-for-skale/[SKALE validator community represents over 45 independent operators] running over 150 nodes, and the SKALE Mainnet has been live for over 300 days without interruption.

== SKALE Chain Types [ Hubs | Apps ]

Hubs are community-operated chains that function as web3 service-layers divided by their specific use-case. (i.e., a hub for defi, a hub for gaming, a hub for NFTs, etc ... )

App chains are SKALE chains that serve single applications.

xref:skale-chain-types.adoc[Read more about this here].

== SKALE Chain Sizes

SKALE Chains can be configured into different sizes - sizes being the amount of resource allocation that each of the 16 nodes provides. xref:infrastructure::skale-chain-sizes.adoc[Read more here].

== Tools & Compatibility

SKALE Network is designed to work with non-custodial wallets, chain agnostic API-based wallets, or those with dedicated support for the SKALE Network, monitoring platforms, and analytic solutions.

== Access a SKALE Chain

If you don't have a SKALE Chain yet, you can get started by using the public SKALE Chain, Chaos Testnet.

Check out the xref:develop::index.adoc#_get_a_skale_endpoint[Develop Page] to access chain information like RPC endpoint and chain id as well as learn how to attain sFuel.

* link:https://skale.space/developers#grants[Apply to the Innovators Program] for a chance to receive a SKALE Mainnet chain grant.
* Having trouble getting started? Then head over to the xref:develop::index.adoc[Develop Page] or reach out to the https://discord.com/invite/gM5XBy6[SKALE Network developer community on Discord].
